### ðŸ‘‹ About me

Hi there! I'm a software engineer specializing in the Rust programming language. I also have a deep interest in programming language design and implementation.

You can find my resume [here](patrick_sullivan_cv.pdf).

### ðŸ”¨ Professional open-source highlights:

Some of my recent job-related contributions have been to open-source projects. 

- While working for OpenObserve, I made many contributions to the company's open-source observability platform. [Here](https://github.com/openobserve/openobserve/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Apatrickcsullivan+is%3Aclosed) is a list of my PRs for that project. 
- While working for Sybridge, I wrote and published an open-source library for performing asynchronous, event-driven job orchestration. That repository is [here](https://github.com/patrickcsullivan/job_orch).
- In order to learn more about 3D graphics, I attempted to port to Rust some of the rendering logic from the [_Physically Based Rendering_](https://www.pbrt.org/) book and its accompanying C++ library. That repository is [here](https://github.com/patrickcsullivan/part_renderer). Although this was a personal project that I pursued in my free time, my team and I at Sybridge ended up incorporating this tool into our production application to generate 3D screenshots for CAD files that customers uploaded to the platform.

Outside of the projects listed above, most of my job-related contributions have been to private repositories. 

### ðŸ“š Personal and academic highlights:

Many of my personal and academic interests in computer science revolve around programming language design and immplementation. Here are a few of my personal projects and writings in that space:

- I implemented a toy compiler while working through part of the [_Essentials of Computation_](https://github.com/IUCompilerCourse/Essentials-of-Compilation) textbook. That respository is [here](https://github.com/patrickcsullivan/logic-lang).
- I ported code for the implementation of a logic programming language in the [_Handbook of Practical Logic and Automated Reasoning_](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/handbook-of-practical-logic-and-automated-reasoning/EB6396296813CB562987E8C37AC4520D) from OCaml to Haskell. This logic language generates Herbrand functional logic resolution proofs. That repository is [here](https://github.com/patrickcsullivan/eoc).
- I wrote a [grant application](https://github.com/patrickcsullivan/documents/blob/master/dependent-types.pdf) to perform graduate research on defining a formal specification and implementing a formally verified compiler for the Idris programming language: 
- For my [undergraduate senior thesis](https://github.com/patrickcsullivan/documents/blob/main/session-types.pdf) I explored the use of session types to enforce mutli-party asynchronous communication protocols.
