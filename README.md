### About me

Hi there! I'm a software engineer specializing in the Rust programming language. I also have a deep interest in programming language design and implementation.

You can find my resume [here](patrick_sullivan_cv.pdf).

### Professional, open-source highlights:

Some of my recent job-related contributions have been to open-source projects. 

- While working for OpenObserve, I made many contributions to the company's open-source observability platform. [Here](https://github.com/openobserve/openobserve/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Apatrickcsullivan+is%3Aclosed) is a list of my PRs from that project. 
- While working for Sybridge, I wrote and published an open-source library for performing asynchronous, event-driven job orchestration. My team experimented with using this library in our proprietary CAD file analysis system. That repository is [here](https://github.com/patrickcsullivan/job_orch).
- In 2021 I wrote a 3D rendering library as part of a personal project to learn more about 3D graphics. That repository is [here](https://github.com/patrickcsullivan/part_renderer). Although this was a personal project that I pursued in my free time, my team and I at Sybridge ended up incorporating this tool into our production application to generate 3D screenshots for CAD files that customers uploaded to our platform.

Outside of the projects listed above, most of my job-related contributions have been to private repositories.
